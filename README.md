*Run main.exe to play!*

The task was to create a snake game in Python. This is my first time doing anything this serious in Python, and found the bracket-less world to be quite fun! Will need to split the program into several files eventually... however that is a task for another day.

Requirements:
------
* Arrow keys control snake movement correctly
* Snake must gain length after eating
* If snake touched edge or self the game is over with an option to restart
* The game must be run from a file not the command line
